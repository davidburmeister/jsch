This is the jsch library, with a minor change. 
When initializing the SSH connection we automatically set the TERM type to xterm-256color, instead of vt100.

TERM is set regardless of what AcceptEnv is set in sshd_config, this is documented in the RFC here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254#section-6.2

To compile:
ANT_HONE/bin/ant -emacs $@

The android branch uses spongy castle (WIP) rather than the android cripped bouncy castle
